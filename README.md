# ArithmeticDemo
A prototype of a modular arithmetic system (using principles by GJS).

# How build
Use javac or your IDE. Entry point is `ArithmeticRepl.java`. Pulls up a command line when run

# How use
Repl will show you a stack. Type literal number to push it. Type `\<char>` to push single-char string `<char>`. `<char>` cannot be whitespace.

Use `pack` command to pack 3 ints to vec.

Use other commands listed at startup (e.g. add, sub, mod) to combine values on stack.

# Question?
Mail me. Am tired. Sleepy now
